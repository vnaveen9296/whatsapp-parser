Analyzing WhatsApp group messages provides a lot of useful informtion. Even a simple stat such as counting how many messages are sent by each user in the group is attractive for others (especially if the group is family/friends)

This is an attempt to parse WhatsApp chat archive in Go and produce the information about how many messages are sent by each user in the group

If you already have Go workspace set up, all you need is 
* ```go get github.com/vnaveen9296/whatsapp-parser```
* ```go install whatsapp-parser```

If your $GO_WORKSPACE/bin is already in PATH, then you can invoke the command as

```whatsapp-parser /path/to/chat.txt```
